IThere have been many more bikes all shapes and sizes customs and racers notably several Suzukis GSXR 750 1100 and lots of enjoyment in France (more difficult now)Lies all Lies , a total dog I wore the centre stand out ground away most of the exhaust, i even took a hack saw to it to get more clearance( jt made it more noisy) The thing weaved stepped out and was sold after 3 months the gas milage turned out to be just 19 mpg at motor-way speeds.I bought the 750 FI after the review in Bike magazine said it was the best handling bike to ever come out of Japan.Hondas followed a 500 four with the loudest exhaust I have ever heard ,sounded like a tortured mini cooper.handled like a pig though you had to be brave or young and stupid, I fell into the second category.Lots of red faces at the traffic lights :))After that I started riding highly tuned Lambrettas 108 mph while the japanese were struggling to get a 250 to do the ton.I started with a demm dove moped, a diabolical piece of kit made in italy . difficult to start, but when running very fast useless brakes and electrics just like lucas, prince of darkness a favorite english electrics supplier of the 50s and 60s.have been riding since it was legal.In 1990 I travelled with my friend[Barrie][0]Now I ride a, Marie Therese his wife and Son Max from Arizona to Sturgis a round trip of 2600 miles a fantastic time was had by all 400.000 bikers turned up for the event in a town with a population of 30.000\.[1200 GS BMW][1]I have recently picked up mybeen doing that for nearly ten years addicted along with many others, a true cult bike quirky ugly but always leaves a grin on my face.[Krugger][2]bike after a long wait these things take time very happy but not without its problems!
