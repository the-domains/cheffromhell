Photography

Snapping away endlessly for decades eventually becomes rewarding, you forget about the technicalities and concentrate on the subject matter . being relaxed seems to allow me to take better pictures. some pictures are opportunities and others are managed ,the skill lies in making them look like opportunities. One day maybe Ill even sell one :-)
