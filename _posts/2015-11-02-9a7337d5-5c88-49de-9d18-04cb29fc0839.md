When I started cooking in the 70s the ultimate menus contained continental cuisine.We now take this for granted Italian food like you enjoyed in rome recently available locally not a problem the chef may be from there or al least have enough passion to have travelled there and experienced the food first hand.In my first brush with this new food I was being educated mostly by those who had not travelled had no affinity and in some cases did not care.
the results were in hindsight atrocious Bolognese sauce that would have you flogged in italy,and so many other poorly executed dishes its no wonder people went abroad for holiday and to enjoy the food.
I was Lucky as we had a Spanish chef who loved food and took me under his wing and ever since I have had an affinity with Spanish food.
